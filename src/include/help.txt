You have until the Comments Close date to make a comment.  If you don't make a comment, you will not get credit for the Discussion. <b>This is a homework grade.</b>
<br>
<br>
You have until the Critiques Close date to critique everyone else's comments. If you don't critique everyone's comments, <i>your homework grade will be penalized.</i>
<br>
<br>
Neither Comments nor Critiques are editable/deletable, except by an administrator. No, I won't make you an administrator.
